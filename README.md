In this assignment, we implemented the GrabCut algorithm to perform foreground segmentation on an input image. 

We replaced the background of the segmented object using Poisson blending, which is a powerful image editing technique that seamlessly blends the foreground object with a new background while preserving the objectâ€™s texture and color.

the implementation is based on the following articles:
